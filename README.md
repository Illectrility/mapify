# info
The touchscreen support has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 with an S Pen. In my testing, it has been important to select the drawing tools using a finger instead of the S Pen to avoid weird zooming and panning behavior. If you use your finger for selecting drawing tools, you should be fine drawing normally with your S Pen. Of course your mileage may vary.
