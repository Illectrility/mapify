- When having the pen or erasing tool selected, the map is locked
- Pressing the pen or eraser button activates the tool, pressing the button again deactivates it
- When wanting to switch from pen to eraser, you need not deactivate the pen to activate the eraser, you can press the eraser button directly and vice versa

# info
The touchscreen support has been tested on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 with an S Pen. In my testing, the S Pen has been causing some unexpected behavior in some brothers (e.g. Via). Using Firefox, it worked without issues. So if you are experiencing issues with using an S Pen, try switching browsers or use a finger instead.
